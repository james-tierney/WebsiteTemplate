                that I am really passionate about and what to share with others, so I thought I would through this website

            <p>My main focus for my art is nature and the environment I love to create pieces related to nature and all that is around us.
                I really enjoy doing seasonal pieces which usually involve me finding a nice spot each season of the year and capturing the view in front of me through my art.
